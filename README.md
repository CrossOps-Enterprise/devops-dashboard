# Syshaven Dashboard

## Overview

Syshaven is an advanced dashboard designed to visualize and manage distributed system architectures. It provides an interactive interface to display, monitor, and analyze complex system flows, as represented by diagrams like the one showcased here. The primary focus is on simplifying system orchestration and providing clarity in multi-environment setups such as production and customer environments. This particular system diagram represents the architecture of **One Diversified**, an enterprise with robust production and customer orchestration systems.

## Key Features

1. **Interactive Diagrams**: View and navigate through system architecture diagrams, including services, APIs, and their interconnections.
2. **Environment Management**: Visualize both production and customer environments to track the interaction between services.
3. **API Gateway Visualization**: Highlight the role and flow of requests through API gateways like KrakenD.
4. **Service Orchestration Insights**: Gain insights into orchestration tools such as Demeter and Jupiter.
5. **Resource Monitoring**: Track resources like S3 storage and applications in the architecture.
6. **Real-Time Updates**: Diagrams dynamically update to reflect changes in system configurations.

## Use Cases

- **System Monitoring**: Quickly identify and address bottlenecks or misconfigurations in distributed architectures.
- **Deployment Visualization**: Track how services like Demeter and Jupiter handle deployments across environments.
- **DevOps Enablement**: Provide DevOps teams with a centralized view of customer environments and operational flows.
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Offer a high-level overview of system architectures for non-technical stakeholders.

## Components

### 1. **Jupiter**

- Responsible for orchestration and deployment in the production environment.
- Manages resources like S3 storage and Spring Boot applications.

### 2. **Demeter**

- Handles intelligent orchestration in customer environments.
- Provides services like S3 storage management and DevOps integration.

### 3. **KrakenD API Gateway**

- Serves as the central gateway for all API requests.
- Ensures secure and efficient communication between services.

## Architecture Diagram Representation

The dashboard diagrams showcase:

- Connections between **Jupiter** (production orchestration) and **Demeter** (customer environment orchestration).
- Interaction between **Demeter API** and external components through the **KrakenD API Gateway**.
- Key resources and services under each environment, like S3 storage and DevOps tasks.

## How to Use Syshaven

1. **Access the Dashboard**: Login to the Syshaven platform.
2. **Navigate Diagrams**: Use the interactive interface to zoom in/out and explore system components.
3. **Monitor Services**: Click on individual components to view detailed information about their roles and status.
4. **Filter Views**: Toggle between production and customer environment views for focused analysis.
5. **Export Reports**: Generate reports of system diagrams for sharing with teams or stakeholders.

## Future Enhancements

- **Alert System Integration**: Notify users of critical changes or failures in the architecture.
- **Customizable Views**: Allow users to personalize diagrams based on roles or responsibilities.
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Provide performance metrics and insights for each system component.
